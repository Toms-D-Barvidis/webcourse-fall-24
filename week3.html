    <title>Week 3 - More HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header id="page_top">
        <h1>Even more HTML</h1>
        <p>Header is for introductory content, maybe importants links for other places. <a href="index.html">Back to main page</a> Writing href="/" also brings you back to the ancestor page. This header tag also includes the property id. The value must be unique; in this case "page_top"</p>
        <p><a href="#footer">Jump to footer</a></p>
    </header>
<main>
    <p>This and all following content is in the main tag, no longer in the header. </p>
    <p>The goal of this class is to showcase semantic tags, show links, include images and even tables. To add images, use the img source. src="link_to_image". Always include alt text! Doing it correctly is creating an image folder here, not hotlink random pictures from the web.</p>
        <h2>Hotlink to an image</h2>
        <div><div><img src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Funny_Dog_H.jpg?crop=16:9&width=960&enable=upscale&quality=100" alt="Silly picture  a dog" height="200" width="280"></div>What happens now?</div>
    <p>Hotlinking pictures is a bad idea. You can look for free images on <a href="unsplash.com" target="_blank">unsplash.com</a> </p>
    <h2>This picture is not hotlinked</h2>
    <p>This picture is stored in the images folder in my Visual Studio Code thingy. This particular picture is just sized down with the height and width properties. It is also embedded within the div tag. It forces the image on a new line (a side effect) and is used to group several elements as blocks.
        <div><img src="images/couches.drawio.png" alt="Flowchart for buying a coach online" width="500" height="250"> <p>Flowchart</p></div>
    </p>
        <p> When using pictures, it's a good idea to size them down. Nobody wants to wait to load a 200 MB picture, no matter how beautiful it is. </p>

     <h2>Embedding a video</h2>
     <p>This is how you embed a video. It uses the iframe tag to display the external content; the tag has width, height, src, title, frameborder and many other properties. <iframe width="1233" height="694" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uFERq9UVYrY" title="Why Bethesda Games Are Getting Worse" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
     <h3>Embedding a map</h3>
     <div>
        <p>I live here!</p>
        <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m12!1m3!1d1018.3487772126329!2d24.13102464605717!3d56.95106168691805!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!5e1!3m2!1sen!2slv!4v1726763378263!5m2!1sen!2slv" width="400" height="300" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe>

     <p>Pages usually start with a header, main and footer tags.</p>
    </main>
</body>
<footer id="footer">
    <p>This is the footer. </p>
    <p> <a href="#page_top"> Back to top.</a> This link has href followed by hastag top id, so #page_top. In quotes, of course.</p>
</footer>
</html>
