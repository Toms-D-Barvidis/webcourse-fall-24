    <title>Week 3 - More HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Even more HTML</h1>
        <p>Header is for introductory content, maybe importants links for other places. <a href="index.html">Back to main page</a> Writing href="/" also brings you back to the ancestor page.</p>
    </header>

    <p>    The goal of this class is to showcase semantic tags, show links, include images and even tables. To add images, use the img source. src="link_to_image". Always include alt text! Doing it correctly is creating an image folder here, not hotlink random pictures from the web.</p>
        <h2>Hotlink to an image</h2>
        <img src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Funny_Dog_H.jpg?crop=16:9&width=960&enable=upscale&quality=100" alt="Silly picture  a dog">
    <p>Hotlinking pictures is a bad idea. You can look for free images on <a href="unsplash.com" target="_blank">unsplash.com</a> </p>
    <h2>This picture is not hotlinked</h2>
    <p>This picture is stored in the images folder in my Visual Studio Code thingy. <img src="images/couches.drawio.png" alt="Flowchart for buying a coach online"></p>
        <p> When using pictures, it's a good idea to size them down. Nobody wants to wait to load a 200 MB picture, no matter how beautiful it is. </p>>
