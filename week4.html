<h2> Internal CSS</h2>
    <p>  There's a paired style tag for including CSS into html docs, but this is the least common way of doing CSS. This body has the tag and between them - body {background-color: aquamarine} that makes this terrible page. Styles that element for the whole page; of course, there is only one header for the page, but if there were many, all would be aquamarine. </p>

    <p>If you select an element and hit Ctrl + D, you get another cursor! And you can have more than just 2! This is actually pretty amazing</p>

    <h2>Inline CSS</h2>
    <p>Inline CSS is added directly to the HTML element. It is not reccomended to use inline CSS for styling the whole pge - it's a lot of work, styling each and every element. In case of conflicting styling, inline styling will win out</p>
    <p style="color: red">This text is red because it has inline style, within the opening p tag </p>
