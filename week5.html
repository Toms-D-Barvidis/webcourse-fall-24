        <h2>Box model</h2>
        <p>Every website is basically just a bunch of boxes - every element is a rectangular box. There are <b>block boxes</b> and <b>inline boxes</b>.</p>
        <h3>Block box elements</h3>
        <p>Occupy the full space of its parent element - has the same width as the parent element. DIV is a classical block element. Multiple elements just keep going down like a stack from top to down. You can use a hack to create a lot of div blocks by typing <i>. * number</i> of elements.</p>
        <p>Paragraphs are blocks, too, but, for example, anchors are not.</p>
        <h4>Examples - DIVs</h4>
        <p>DIV is a block without a semantic meaning, it is used to organize other elements. So, websites are mostly just a bunch of DIVs.</p>
        <div class="primy">Block element 1</div>
        <div class="secondy" >Block element 2</div>
        <div class="primy">Block element 3</div>
        <div class="secondy">Block element 4</div>
        <h3>Inline box elements</h3>
        <p>
            Inline elements follow each other in the same line, hence inline elements; they continue within the width of the parent element. Anchors are an inline element. If you want an inline element to act as a block element, just put it in a DIV lmao hack.
        </p>
        <p>Inline elements are sorta evil and will drive you crazy. Their sizes are really hard to change.</p>
        <p>A generic inline element is SPAN.</p>
        <h4>Examples - SPAN</h4>
        <p>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet <span class="spanny">span something span</span> and also <strong> strong</strong>. Lorem ipsum dolor <em>sit amet, consectetur</em> adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut <span class="spenny"> labore et dolore magna </span>aliqua.

        <h2>Margins and padding</h2>
        <p>Margins can be defined in pixels, centimers or percent. Actually, also inches and whatnot, but who even does that, wtf. Pixels are pretty standard, but percent makes it keep those settings when zooming in and out.</p>
        <div class="blocky-1">Block element 1 - This one has a margin of 10 px, lightblue background and a border of 3 px, solid and black.</div>
        <div class="blocky-2">Block element 2 - This one has a border that has rounded corners, border-radius controls the roundedness of them.</div>
        <div class="blocky-3">Block element 3 - This one has padding. Margins separate elements. Padding separates content from borders.</div>
        <div class="blocky-4">Block element 4 - This has relative positioning.</div>
        <div class="blocky-5">Block element 5 - This one has absolute positioning.</div>
        <div class="blocky-6">Block element 6 - Fixed positioning.</div>
        <p><br><br>Moving on to positioning...</p>
        <h2>Positioning</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Static - default. Puts the element in the flow.</li>
            <li>Relative - based on parent element. Just CSS for blocky-4. Use wisely, the elements can end up overlapping some other element.</li>
            <li>Absolute - will take the element out of the flow / the normal layout. It pushes the element to the nearest defined position of a parent element, unless defined. Used very rarely and fucks up everything. Check block element 5.</li>
            <li>Fixed - much more useful than absolute, but relative to viewport, not parent element. Check block element 6. Can be useful for navigation or other elemements like that.</li>
        </ul>    
        </p>
        <p>There's also z index for controlling which element is on top in case of overlapping elements. Default is zero, elements with higher index are pushed to the surface. </p>
