    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>A page should have only Heading 1.</p>
    <p>HTML is developed and maintained my Mozilla. Yes, the same Firefox Mozilla people. Read more about the basics of HTML <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics">here on the dev site.</a></p>
    <h2>Second heading</h2>
    <p>There's a limited number of heading tags, going down to six, but not further. If you use more than h3, maybe you should rethink the design.</p>
    <h2>Let's add something else</h2>
    <p>We're having a lot of fun with HTML code and GitHub. I think we're about to add a link now. But first, a list! Unordered list:
        <ul>
            <li>First item</li>
            <li>Another item</li>
            <li>Last item</li>
        </ul>
    The order of the items does not matter with unordered lists. An ordered list has numbers:
    <ol>
        <li> <a href="https://github.com/Toms-D-Barvidis/RTU-DE0824-Web-Dev" target="_blank"> Item </a></li>
        <li>Item</li>
        <li>Item</li>
        <li>Item</li>
    </ol>
    Just a test here to see if changes are pushed to GitHub, because I had a lot of problems with setting up that connection.

    <p>Weekly pages
        <ul>
            <li><a href="week3.html"> Week 3 - this is a relative link</a>; "wherever you are, just add the link from the a tag" </li>
            <li><a href="week4.html"> Week 4 - starting CSS basics</a></li>
            <li><a href="week5.html"> Week 5 - CSS Positioning and layout</a></li>
            <li><a href="week6.html"> Week 6 - Media Queries and Flexbox </a></li>
            <li><a href="week7.html"> Week 7 - CSS Grid and Pseudoclasses </a></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
