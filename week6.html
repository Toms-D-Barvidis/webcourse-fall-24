        <h2>Media Queries</h2>
        <p>MQ allow to apply different CSS styles depending on a device's media type (e.g. print vs screen), screen resolution, orientation, aspect ration, width and height, etc. More on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp">W3 schools here</a>.</p>
        <p>Media Queries are implemented for specific resolutions, and they act upon CSS styling. Essentially, they work conditionally. It starts with a @media thingy, then has a rule, i.e. <br>
            <div class="code">@media (max-width: 1250px){...}</div><br> 
        and then you just add normal css into the condition. </p>
        <p>So you just state a condition and what formatting should apply if that condition is true. You can include several CSS rules within a single @media query. </p>
